# Elasti

Elasti is a cloud-native tool to facilitate serverless capabilities within Kubernetes services. It intercepts and queues requests directed to a service that has been scaled down to zero instances, then scales the service up, and subsequently forwards the queued requests to the now active service.


>  The name Elasti comes from a superhero "Elasti-Girl" from DC Comics. Her supower is to expand or shrink her body at willâ€”from hundreds of feet tall to mere inches in height.

# Problem Statement
TBA

# Installation

You will be able to install the Elasti Tool by applying the `install.yaml` manifest.

After this, you can start creating elastiService, you can find a sample at `./playground/config/watch-crd.yaml`.
Please use the exact format.


# Development

Here are the steps to deploy Elasti in your kubernetes cluster. 
For now, we will need to deploy the Elasti-Operator and Elasti-Resolver separately.

### Setup Docker

This is required to publish our docker images, and pull them inside our manifest files. 

1. Login to the docker hub via CLI.
```bash
docker login -u ramantehlan
# When asked for password, paste below text.
dckr_pat_WgMJEsO0nMNp10Bf7rLQ_FcVzLU
``` 

> That's it, now you will be able to push changes to images. Since the images are public, pulling it doesn't require any changes.

### Build Resolver

We will build and publish our resolver changes.

1. Go into resolver directory. 
2. Run build and publish command.
```bash
make docker-build-resolver docker-publish-resolver IMG=ramantehlan/elasti-resolver:latest  
```

### Build Operator

We will build and publish our Operator changes.

1. Go into operator directory.
2. Run build and publish command.
```bash
make docker-build-resolver docker-publish-resolver IMG=ramantehlan/elasti-resolver:latest
```

> Once your changes are published, you can re-deploy in your cluster.
