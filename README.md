# Elasti

Elasti is a cloud-native tool to facilitate serverless capabilities within Kubernetes services. It intercepts and queues requests directed to a service that has been scaled down to zero instances, then scales the service up, and subsequently forwards the queued requests to the now active service.


>  The name Elasti comes from a superhero "Elasti-Girl" from DC Comics. Her supower is to expand or shrink her body at willâ€”from hundreds of feet tall to mere inches in height.
